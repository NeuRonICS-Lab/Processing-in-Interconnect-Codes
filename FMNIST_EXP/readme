This directory contains scripts for training and comparing conventional MAC-based LeNet-5 networks with π²-based LeNet-5 architectures on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

Training_teacher.py
Baseline training of a conventional MAC-based LeNet-5 network on Fashion-MNIST.
Used as a teacher model for comparison and potential distillation.

pi_2_train.py
Trains a π²-based LeNet-5 network (TEMP neuron replacements) on Fashion-MNIST.
Evaluates accuracy, convergence, and energy-efficiency compared to the teacher.

pi_2_constrain_K.py
Trains π² LeNet-5 networks with K-constraints:

K=1 → strict TTFS mode (single earliest spike propagation).

K=10 → more flexible approximation, enabling richer representations.
