# Processing-in-Interconnect-Codes

This repository contains implementations of **Ï€Â² (Processing-in-Interconnect)** neural network layers and architectures, along with training/evaluation scripts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR datasets. The project leverages [Lightning Fabric](https://lightning.ai/docs/fabric/stable/) for distributed training, mixed precision, and scaling across GPUs.
