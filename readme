Processing-in-Interconnect-Codes

This repository contains implementations of Ï€Â² (Processing-in-Interconnect) neural network layers and architectures, along with training/evaluation scripts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR datasets. The project leverages Lightning Fabric
for distributed training, mixed precision, and scaling across GPUs.

ðŸ”§ Environment Setup
We recommend using conda:
# Create a fresh environment
conda create -n fabric2 python==3.10 -y
conda activate fabric2

# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision lightning fabric deepspeed
