This directory contains PyTorch/Fabric training scripts and notebooks for experimenting with π² (processing-in-interconnect) networks and their relationship to conventional MLPs on the MNIST dataset.
In all  these files, mention the path of the current directory where you copy the repository before running the codes. 

1. fabric_MLP.py
Baseline training script: trains a 3-layer conventional MLP on MNIST using the PyTorch Lightning Fabric
framework.

2. fabric_PI2_1.py
Trains a π² network with K=1 constraints applied in both the hidden and output layers, mimicking strict TTFS coding.

3. fabric_PI2_hidden_1.py
Trains a π² network with K=1 constraint only in the hidden layer, while allowing flexible K at the output layer.

4. mnist800_PI2.py
Fabric-based training of a large π² network with architecture 784–800–10 (input → hidden → output) on MNIST.

5. PI2_neuron_model_can_learn_mnist.ipynb
Jupyter notebook analyzing the relationship between π² neurons and conventional MAC-based neurons, showing how π²-K models approximate inner-product computations.
